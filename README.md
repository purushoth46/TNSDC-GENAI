# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project aims to recognize handwritten digits using machine learning techniques. It employs various algorithms and models to achieve accurate classification of digits ranging from 0 tMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmo 9.

## Introduction

Handwritten digit recognition is a classic problem in the field of machine learning and computer vision. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify images of handwritten digits into their corresponding numerical representations. This project explores various machine learning algorithms and techniques to achieve this objective.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the MNIST dataset, which is a widely-used benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). Each image is a grayscale 28x28 pixel image, making it a suitable choice for training and testing machine learning models.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the project:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- TensorFlow (for deep learning models)
- Keras (for deep learning models)

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib tensorflow keras
```

## Usage

To train and evaluate the models, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/handwritten-digit-recognition.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd handwritten-digit-recognition
```

3. Run the main script:

```
python main.py
```

This will train the models and evaluate their performance on the MNIST dataset.

## Models

The project implements the following machine learning models:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

Each model is trained and evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Evaluation

The performance of each model is evaluated using cross-validation techniques and various evaluation metrics. The results are displayed and compared to determine the effectiveness of each algorithm in recognizing handwritten digits.
